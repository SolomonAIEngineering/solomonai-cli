# use{{pascalCase name}}Api Hook ## Overview The `use{{pascalCase name}}Api`
hook is designed to fetch and manage data from the `/api/{{kebabCase name}}`
endpoint. This hook encapsulates all logic related to making the API request,
handling the state of the request, and processing the response or errors. ##
Usage Below is an example of how to use the `use{{pascalCase name}}Api` hook in
a component: ```jsx import React from 'react'; import { use{{pascalCase
	name
}}Api } from 'path/to/hooks'; const
{{pascalCase name}}Component = () => { const { data, loading, error } = use{{pascalCase
	name
}}Api(); if (loading) return
<p>Loading...</p>; if (error) return
<p>Error: {error.message}</p>; return (
<div>
	<h1>Data from {{pascalCase name}}</h1>
	<pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>
</div>
); }; export default
{{pascalCase name}}Component; ## Parameters This hook does not require any
parameters and triggers a fetch operation when the component mounts. ## Returns
The use{{pascalCase name}}Api hook returns an object containing the following
properties: data:
{{pascalCase name}}Data | null — The data fetched from the API or null if no
data has been fetched or in case of an error. loading: boolean — Indicates
whether the API request is in progress. error: Error | null — Contains an error
object if an error occurred during the fetch operation. ## Handling Errors
Errors are managed internally within the hook and are exposed via the error
object in the hook's return value. This allows the consuming component to easily
render error states based on the presence of the error object. ### Example of
Error Handling Here's how you might handle errors in a component using this
hook: ```jsx const
{{pascalCase name}}ErrorHandlingComponent = () => { const { error } = use{{pascalCase
	name
}}Api(); if (error) { console.error('Failed to fetch data:', error); return
<div>Error fetching data. Please try again later.</div>; } // Component
rendering goes here }; ``` ## Additional Notes Ensure that the API endpoint
'/api/{{kebabCase name}}' is correctly set up and accessible. This hook is
optimized for performance by minimizing re-renders and reducing unnecessary
network requests. ### Explanation of the Template Content: 1. **Overview**:

application. 2. **Usage**: Shows a simple example of how to use the hook in a
React component, demonstrating handling of loading and error states. 3.
**Parameters**: Describes any parameters the hook accepts; for this template,
it's noted that no parameters are required. 4. **Returns**: Details what the
hook returns, explaining each part of the returned object. 5. **Handling
Errors**: Discusses how errors are handled within the hook and how they can be
rendered in a component. 6. **Additional Notes**: Any other relevant
information, such as API endpoint setup and performance considerations. ###
